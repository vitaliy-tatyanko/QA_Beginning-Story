More n more people THese days have cellphoneS as a means of cmmunicatin' with family n friends. 

It just helps you stay in touch, so if I WANNA talk to a friend, I just call'er up no matteR wheRe I am. 

Also, I can TAKE and SEND pictures with my cellphone, so I really don’t need an extra cЭmera.

Uf course, if my friend doesn’t have heR cellphone turnd on, then I can just ЛИВ a мэсэдж and Эsk'er to call me back

. A cellphone also comes in handy in case of an emergency and you need to call for help, for example, if your car breaks down, and you need assistance. To be honest, I don’t think I could live without my cellphone.

Sad but True
Don't know wat's going on
